# **Wave Function Collapse Map Generator** 🗺️🎲  

This project implements **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) for procedural map generation**, creating structured and visually coherent maps based on input patterns. WFC is an algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics that efficiently generates diverse and tile-based worlds, commonly used in **games and procedural content generation**.
