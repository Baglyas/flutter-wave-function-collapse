Wave Function Collapse Map Generator 🗺️🎲

This project implements Wave Function Collapse (WFC) for procedural map generation, creating structured and visually coherent maps based on input patterns. WFC is an algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics that efficiently generates diverse and tile-based worlds, commonly used in games and procedural content generation.

Features
	•	🧩 Tile-based Map Generation – Creates structured maps using predefined tile sets.
	•	⚡ Efficient Propagation – Optimized constraint solving for rapid generation.
	•	🎮 Game-Ready Integration – Suitable for use in roguelikes, strategy games, and open-world environments.
	•	🎨 Customizable Patterns – Supports different tile sets and configurations.
	•	📏 Ensures Connectivity – Validates road/path connectivity to prevent dead-ends (WIP).

Tech Stack
	•	Language: [Specify language used, e.g., Dart, Python, C++]
	•	Algorithm: Wave Function Collapse (Overlapping/Tile-based)
	•	Rendering: [Specify if you’re using a game engine like Unity, Godot, or a custom solution]

About the Project

This implementation aims to explore procedural generation principles, improving level design automation while maintaining logical map structures. The goal is to generate high-quality maps where paths, roads, and key elements connect properly, ensuring a playable environment.
